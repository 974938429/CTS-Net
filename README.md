In the above image, the spider is cropped by Photoshop. When you zoom in locally, there is a translucent edge around contour. When you paste the spider in image, the translucent edge will overlap with the authentic pixels at the corresponding position. If neighboring pixels have similar colors, the translucent edge will weaken the unnatural transition between two parts, which is the feathering effect.
